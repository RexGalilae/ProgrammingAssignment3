Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Codebook
Pretty standard. Loosely based off of the codebook for Housing Data found in Quiz 1 of the course.

### R Script
The scripted file is laid out to methodically illustrate the implementations of all the 5 steps outlined in the assignment description. F.ex. Function 5, ```create_mean_tidy_set()``` calls Function 4, ```rename_variables()```, to get the output from performing the first 4 steps to then implement the 5th step outlined in the assignemnt desription and so on.

**Note: The R Script must be contained within the main directory belonging to the UCI HAR dataset alongside other files like ```features.txt```**
